Currently enrolled in École 42’s Common Core.
So far, I’ve worked mainly with C, C++, and Makefiles, diving deep into logic, memory, and structure.
Always curious, and ready to learn.

As of this moment, learning advanced C++ concepts and exploring graphics programming. 
Some side progets on the way!
